Cloudy morning, eyes focused on you.<br>
I would have begged the sun to shine a bit brighter,<br>
knowing you would love the view.<br><br>

Hushed the birds,<br>
pushed the wind into a box.<br>
Your every heartbeat and word would be heard.<br>
Let them echo loud and clear in my ears,<br>
as I run my hands through your locs.<br><br>

Throw everything else in darkness,<br>
hold you as long as the sea roars.<br>
Go cold, nothing can break through,<br>
enjoy oneness.<br><br>

Cut ties with my dear pride,<br>
store the blade, I want all of you.<br>
Like the groom to his bride.<br>
And the tears I held back?<br>
I would let them fall,<br>
every drop saying I love you and want you back.
