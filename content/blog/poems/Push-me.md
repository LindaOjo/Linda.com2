Why do you do this? <br>
Drag me to the edge of the cliff and ask me to jump.<br>
Tell me the wind will rush through my hair as I plumet down to my doom.<br>
Knowing surely only strong winds can do that to my thick hair.<br><br>

Why don't you push me.<br>
Push me, so my mother would have someone to haunt.<br>
After life might be boring.<br>
Push me off this cliff so my father would have some to hate.<br>
I don't want him to spend his days wondering why I jumped.<br><br>

Come on, let's give the cliff something to brag about.<br>
I bet it's body count is low.<br>
Push me so I can enjoy the fall, please.<br>
